The master node requests data from the slave nodes, and the expected serial output (via UART debugging) look like:

Master: Requesting data from Slave 1...
Slave 1: Sending data - Temperature: 25°C, Light Intensity: 320
Master: Received - Temp: 25°C, Light: 320

Master: Requesting data from Slave 2...
Slave 2: Sending data - Temperature: 24°C, Light Intensity: 290
Master: Received - Temp: 24°C, Light: 290

Master: Requesting data from Slave 3...
Slave 3: Sending data - Temperature: 26°C, Light Intensity: 340
Master: Received - Temp: 26°C, Light: 340
